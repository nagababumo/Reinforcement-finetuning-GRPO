      "I'm very pleased with the strong start to 2021 and the positive momentum in revenue and margins we delivered in the first quarter, demonstrating the strong operating leverage in our business.\n",
      "Consolidated revenues increased 11.1% year-over-year in our first full quarter as a stand-alone public company.\n",
      "The revenue increase included same-store revenue growth of 14.8% and we reported adjusted EBITDA margin that improved to 15.4% of revenues.\n",
      "This is the first quarter in over a decade that the Company has delivered double-digit same-store revenue growth.\n",
      "Our teams in the field and our store support centers and Woodhaven are performing at a very high level and are energized and engaged.\n",
      "As I visit Aaron's stores around the country to support our operations team, I'm seeing a strong sense of pride and optimism about our brand and our competitive position.\n",
      "Our team members and customers are embracing the innovation that we are delivering and the dynamic lease-to-own market.\n",
      "Over the last five years, we've significantly transformed the company for the goal of continuing to provide an exceptional customer and team member experience while also driving greater efficiencies in our operating model.\n",
      "I'm proud to say that as of today we have a centralized decisioning platform that provides greater control and predictability resulting in a higher quality lease portfolio.\n",
      "We have enhanced digital payment platforms that are enabling over 75% of monthly customer payments to be made outside of our stores.\n",
      "We have an industry-leading, fully transactional e-commerce platform that is attracting a new and younger customer, and we have a portfolio of 51 GenNext stores that is currently outperforming our expectations with many more store openings in the pipeline.\n",
      "All of these initiatives are underpinned by the investments that we have made in enhanced analytics and when combined with our more efficient operations are enabling us to deliver strong revenue and earnings growth.\n",
      "These transformations to our business model are contributing to our outstanding performance in the first quarter of 2021.\n",
      "We are encouraged by the continuing improvement and the quality and size of our same-store lease portfolio, which ended the quarter up 6.2% compared to the end of the first quarter of 2020.\n",
      "This improvement was primarily driven by strong demand for our products, few release merchandise returns, and lower inventory write-offs.\n",
      "In addition, our customer continues to benefit from the ongoing government stimulus, one of the most meaningful contributors to our strong portfolio performance was centralized decisioning, which we implemented across all Company-operated stores in the U.S., in the spring of 2020.\n",
      "Today, nearly 70% of our portfolio is made up of lease agreements that were originated using this technology.\n",
      "Centralized decisioning delivers consistency and predictability in the performance of our lease portfolio.\n",
      "It enables store managers the flexibility to focus their time on growth-oriented activities such as sales and lease servicing.\n",
      "We believe our algorithms provide better outcomes for both the customer and Aaron's with the goal of having a greater number of customers achieve ownership while at the same time reducing our cost to serve.\n",
      "We continue to refine this decisioning across our various channels, and we expect this will continue to drive greater productivity from our lease portfolio.\n",
      "Another contributor to our strong performance in the quarter was our e-commerce channel, which represented more than 14% of lease revenues.\n",
      "Our e-commerce team has really delivered, driving traffic growth to aarons.com by 12.8% and increasing revenues by 42% in the first quarter as compared to the prior-year quarter.\n",
      "E-commerce lease originations increased as compared to the year-ago quarter despite the significant shift of customer activity through our online platform in March of 2020 as stores closed during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "In addition, e-commerce write-offs improved by more than 50% compared to last year's quarter, primarily as a result of ongoing decisioning optimization, operational enhancements, and strong customer payment activity.\n",
      "Our e-commerce team continues to deliver ongoing improvements through our online customer acquisition, conversion, and servicing capabilities, which is leading to margin growth and continued positive momentum in this important channel.\n",
      "Our e-commerce growth in the quarter is enabled by our stores, which are not just showrooms and service centers but are also last-mile logistics hubs delivering an expanded assortment of products with same or next day delivery.\n",
      "Finally, our Real estate repositioning and reinvestment strategy is gaining momentum and we expect it will drive future growth.\n",
      "Our new GenNext stores have larger and more modern showrooms, expanded product assortment, and improved brand imaging and digital technologies.\n",
      "To date, we have opened 51 new GenNext stores and have generated results that are meeting or exceeding our targeted internal rate of return equally as encouraging, monthly lease originations in the first quarter.\n",
      "Our plan for 2021 is to plan to open in the second and third quarters.\n",
      "While we're excited about both the early financial results and the infrastructure we're building to accelerate our progress, we continue to maintain a disciplined approach around our execution of this strategy.\n",
      "We remain focused on our key strategic initiatives of simplifying and digitizing the customer experience, aligning our store footprint to our customer opportunity and promoting the Aaron's value proposition of low payments high approval rates and best-in-class service.\n",
      "For the first quarter of 2021, revenues were $481.1 million compared to $432.8 million for the first quarter of 2020, an increase of 11.1%.\n",
      "The increase in revenues was primarily due to the improving quality and increased size of our lease portfolio and strong customer payment activity during the quarter, aided in part by government stimulus and partially offset by the net reduction of 166 Company-operated and franchised stores compared to the prior year.\n",
      "As Douglas called out earlier, e-commerce revenues were up 42% compared to the first quarter of the prior year and represented 14.2% of overall lease revenues compared to 11.3% in 2020.\n",
      "On a same-store revenue basis, revenues increased 14.8% in the first quarter compared to the prior-year quarter, the first double-digit, same-store revenue growth since 2009, and our fourth consecutive positive quarter.\n",
      "Same-store revenue growth was primarily driven by a larger same-store lease portfolio and strong customer payment activity, including retail sales and early purchase option exercises.\n",
      "We believe this growth is partially a result of the government stimulus programs passed in 2020 and 2021.\n",
      "Additionally, the company ended the first quarter of 2021 with a lease portfolio size for all company operated stores of $128.8 million, an increase of 3.6% compared to the lease portfolio size as of March 31, 2020.\n",
      "Lease portfolio size represents the next month's total collectible lease payments from our aggregate outstanding customer lease agreements.\n",
      "Operating expenses excluding restructuring expenses, spin-related transaction costs and the impairment of goodwill and other expenses, which were both recorded in the first quarter of 2020 were down $1.5 million as compared to the first quarter of last year.\n",
      "This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in write-offs, store closures and the impact of the COVID-related reserves recorded in 2020, partially offset by higher personnel costs related to variable performance compensation, higher marketing expenses and an increase in bank and credit card related fees.\n",
      "Adjusted EBITDA was $73.9 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared with $34.7 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of $39.2 million or 112.9%.\n",
      "As a percentage of total revenues, adjusted EBITDA was 15.4% in the first quarter of 2021 compared with 8% for the same period last year, an improvement of 740 basis points.\n",
      "The improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily due to the items that drove the total revenues increase and a 310 basis point reduction in overall write-offs to 3.1% of lease revenues, including both improvement in the e-commerce and store origination channels compared to the prior year.\n",
      "The improvement in write-offs was due primarily to the implementation of new decisioning technology, improved operations, the benefit of government stimulus and the impact of COVID-related lease merchandise reserves recorded in the first quarter of 2020 and not repeated in 2021.\n",
      "On a non-GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share were $1.24 in the first quarter of 2021 compared to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.30 for the same quarter in 2020, an increase of $0.94 or 313.3%.\n",
      "Cash generated from operating activities was $20.2 million for the first quarter of 2021, a decline of $36.6 million compared to the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher inventory purchases, partially offset by higher customer payments and other changes in working capital.\n",
      "During the quarter, the company purchased 252,200 shares of Aaron's common stock for a total purchase price of approximately $6.3 million.\n",
      "As of the end of the quarter, we had approximately $143.7 million remaining under the company's share repurchase authorization that was approved by our Board on March 3rd of this year.\n",
      "The Company's Board of Directors also declared our first quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share last month and we paid the dividend on April 6.\n",
      "As of March 31, 2021 the company had a cash balance of $61.1 million, less than $500,000 of debt and total available liquidity of $295.5 million.\n",
      "Turning to our outlook, based on our performance in the first quarter of 2021 and the passage of the American Rescue Plan Act in March, we have revised our full-year 2021 outlook.\n",
      "For the full year, we expect consolidated revenues of between $1.725 billion and $1.775 billion representing an increase in our revenue outlook of $75 million.\n",
      "We also expect adjusted EBITDA of between $190 and $205 million, representing an increase in our adjusted EBITDA outlook of $35 million.\n",
      "For the full year 2021, our outlook for the effective tax rate, depreciation and amortization and diluted weighted average share count are unchanged.\n",
      "We have also increased our full-year same-store revenue outlook from a range of 0% to 2% to a range of 4% to 6%.\n",
      "Similar to our original outlook, total revenue and adjusted EBITDA in the first half of 2021 are expected to be higher in the second half of 2021.\n",
      "This outlook assumes no impact from the expansion and acceleration of the child tax credit payments expected to begin in July 2021.\n",
      "Additionally, our updated outlook assumes no significant deterioration in the current retail environment or in the state of the U.S. economy, as compared to its current condition and a continued improvement in global supply chain conditions.\n",
      "test: For those of you that have not, it is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.\n",
      "I'm pleased to report another quarter of strong operating performance and continued positive momentum at the Aaron's Company.\n",
      "In the nearly one year since our separation, we have significantly strengthened our leadership position in the direct-to-consumer lease end market and are tracking well ahead of our long-term strategic plan.\n",
      "Continued investments in our best-in-class e-commerce channel, predictive lease decisioning engine and our high performing GenNext stores are driving greater productivity and growth in our business.\n",
      "Through the tremendous efforts of our team, we continue to transform Aaron's go-to-market strategy by delivering customer friendly digital solutions, easy lease approvals and an enhanced shopping experience.\n",
      "Since 1955, Aaron's has been committed to serving a customer base that has too often been overlooked or excluded from preferred retail experiences.\n",
      "Today, we are leveraging our long and deep understanding of this customer segment to say yes when others say no; to provide our customers with access to great products on flexible and affordable terms and to deliver a seamless customer experience not only across our distributed store network but also digitally through our award winning e-commerce platform.\n",
      "Whether our customers interact with us in one of our beautiful new GenNext stores or via their mobile device, we continue to provide a growing assortment of products they want and need with low monthly payments that fit their budget and best-in-class customer service.\n",
      "I'm pleased to announce that our third quarter 2021 results have again exceeded our expectations through continued growth in the size of our lease portfolio same-store revenues and e-commerce revenues.\n",
      "As a result, we returned another $37.5 million to shareholders in the quarter in the form of share repurchases.\n",
      "This brings us to a total of nearly $100 million of capital returned to shareholders thus far this year.\n",
      "The strong third quarter results, we are again raising our revenue and earnings outlook for the full year 2021.\n",
      "In the third quarter, same-store revenues grew 4.6% compared to the prior year, the sixth consecutive quarter of positive same-store revenue growth.\n",
      "The improvement was primarily driven by an 8.7% larger lease portfolio size entering the third quarter partially offset by a lower level of customer payment activity compared to the prior year.\n",
      "Our same-store lease portfolio size continues to grow at a healthy pace ending the third quarter up 6.1% compared to the prior year.\n",
      "We attribute this growth primarily to strong demand for our products, higher average ticket, the favorable impact of centralized lease decisioning and the residual impact of government stimulus on the portfolio.\n",
      "As discussed previously, our predictive lease decisioning engine is working very well and enables us to better match the customers' lease payment with their financial position with the goal of helping more customers achieve ownership and lowering our overall cost to serve.\n",
      "In addition, our lease decisioning algorithms allow us to be flexible in responding to changes in the macroeconomic environment and to optimize outcomes that drive profitability.\n",
      "As of the end of the third quarter, more than 83% of our total lease portfolio is comprised of lease agreements that were originated through our centralized decisioning platforms.\n",
      "This compares to approximately 60% at the beginning of 2021.\n",
      "As I mentioned last quarter, lease payment activity in 2021 has exceeded historical levels due to the government stimulus provided to our customer leading to higher lease renewal rates and lower write-offs as we saw in the third quarter and expect to see over the next three to four quarters, customer payment activity continues to normalize.\n",
      "Because of investments we've made in centralized decisioning and lease servicing technologies, we expect 2022 lease renewal rates to ultimately settle above pre-pandemic levels but below the level we expect for the full year 2021.\n",
      "We also expect lease merchandise write-offs in 2022 to settle below pre-pandemic levels but above the level we expect for full year 2021.\n",
      "In addition to investments in our decisioning technology, we also continue to invest in our e-commerce channel and our GenNext strategy.\n",
      "Our e-commerce channel continues to grow at double-digit rates representing 14.3% of total lease revenues in the quarter.\n",
      "The growth in our portfolio of leases generated online is driving improvements to our overall margin performance as we leverage the fixed cost structure of our store and supply chain assets to serve customers that are seeking a virtual shopping experience, low monthly payments and free delivery.\n",
      "Ongoing investments in digital marketing and our customers' online experience are driving growth in this important channel, specifically e-commerce investments are leading to an enhanced shopping experience driven by personalization and richer product content improved customer visibility into products that are available for same or next day delivery and a broader assortment that includes new product categories.\n",
      "Today we have more than 3,000 products on aaron's.com, which is double from a year ago.\n",
      "And our express delivery program accounts for approximately 30% of e-commerce volume.\n",
      "Because of this, we're generating a higher customer conversion rate, lowering our effective acquisition costs and delivering higher customer satisfaction.\n",
      "I could not be happier with the efforts of our team and the growing marketplace we're creating on aaron's.com.\n",
      "As we discussed last quarter, our GenNext stores continue to perform at a high level.\n",
      "During the third quarter, we increased the size of our GenNext store set by 22 to end the quarter with 86 locations.\n",
      "And we believe we remain on track to have more than 100 GenNext stores by the end of the year.\n",
      "To date, our portfolio of GenNext stores is generating results that are exceeding our targeted 25% internal rate of return and 5-year payback period.\n",
      "Equally as encouraging, monthly lease originations in GenNext stores open for less than one year again grew at a rate of more than 20 percentage points higher than our average legacy stores.\n",
      "Stores, we continue to maintain a disciplined approach around our execution of the strategy.\n",
      "Our merchandising and supply chain teams have performed exceptionally well by getting ahead of market disruptions, by procuring inventory and expanding output from our Woodhaven manufacturing facilities.\n",
      "As a result, we are entering the holiday season with strong inventory levels in both our stores and distribution centers and we have been increasing prices to respond to inflationary pressures and maintain product margins.\n",
      "I remain encouraged by the underlying performance of both our store and e-commerce channels as we're tracking well ahead of our 5-year plan on revenue and earnings.\n",
      "For the third quarter of 2021, total revenues were $452.2 million compared with $441 million for the third quarter of 2020, an increase of 2.5%.\n",
      "The increase in revenues was primarily due to the increased size of our lease portfolio, partially offset by the expected lower customer payment activity during the quarter and the reduction of 79 franchise stores during the 15-month period ended September 30, 2021.\n",
      "Lease revenues in the third quarter of this year also benefited by an increase in ticket size or monthly rent for agreement, that is offsetting the inflation we are experiencing in the cost of lease merchandise.\n",
      "On a same-store basis, lease and retail revenues increased 4.6% in the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter.\n",
      "As Douglas mentioned, this is our sixth consecutive positive quarter of same-store revenue growth.\n",
      "Leases originated in both our e-commerce and in-store channels contributed to our revenue growth, which was primarily driven by a larger same-store lease portfolio size, partially offset by the expected lower customer payment activity in the quarter.\n",
      "More specifically, in the third quarter of this year, our customer lease renewal rate was 89.7%, which was approximately 230 basis points higher than the 3-year third quarter pre-pandemic average but was approximately 130 basis points lower than the third quarter of last year.\n",
      "For any period, the customer lease renewal rate is calculated by dividing the amount of customer payments recorded on an accrual basis as of the end of such period by the amount of total customer lease payments due for renewal during that period.\n",
      "As discussed on our last earnings call, the benefits to our customer from government stimulus programs declined in the third quarter and as expected, resulted in lower customer payment activity as compared to the prior year.\n",
      "We expect customer payment activity to continue to decline year-over-year for the next three or four quarters.\n",
      "And I will point out that a 100 basis point change up or down in customer lease renewal rates or write-offs on a $1.6 billion annual portfolio of total collectible customer lease payments results in a $16 million change in EBITDA.\n",
      "Additionally, we continue to expect that customer payment activity will benefit from our investments in centralized decisioning.\n",
      "We estimate that this technology has improved lease renewal rates by over 100 basis points compared to the pre-pandemic levels, while also materially improving the customer experience and simplifying the day-to-day activities at our stores.\n",
      "E-commerce revenues increased 13.3% versus the third quarter of 2020 and represented 14.3% of overall lease revenues compared to 13.1% in the third quarter of the prior year.\n",
      "We continue to make investments in this important channel that we believe will continue to drive long-term growth for the company.\n",
      "The company ended the third quarter of 2021 with a lease portfolio size for all company-operated stores of $132.2 million, an increase of 5.8% compared to a lease portfolio size of $125 million on September 30 of last year.\n",
      "As a reminder, lease portfolio size represents the next month's total collectible lease payments from our aggregate outstanding customer lease agreements.\n",
      "Management believes this is one of the metrics that is important in understanding the drivers of future lease revenue.\n",
      "Total operating expenses, excluding restructuring expenses and spin-related costs were up $15.7 million in the quarter as compared to the third quarter of last year.\n",
      "This increase is due primarily to higher personnel costs and a higher provision for lease merchandise write-offs.\n",
      "Personnel costs increased $5.1 million in the third quarter of 2021 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher wages in our stores, additional personnel to support our key strategic initiatives and higher stand-alone public company costs.\n",
      "Additionally, personnel costs were lower-than-anticipated during the third quarter this year as staffing levels in our stores remain below our operational targets due to the current challenges in the US labor market for retail-based hourly employees.\n",
      "Other operating expenses were relatively flat to the prior year period due to higher occupancy, shipping and handling costs, professional services and bank and credit card-related fees.\n",
      "These increases were partially offset by lower advertising costs in the third quarter of 2021 versus the prior year period.\n",
      "The provision for lease merchandise write-offs as a percentage of lease revenues and fees was 4.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared to an all-time low of 2.4% in the comparable period in 2020.\n",
      "The increase in write-offs in the third quarter of this year compared to last year was primarily due to lower customer payment activity following several quarters where our customers received financial assistance in the form of government stimulus payments and supplemental federal unemployment benefits.\n",
      "This normalization in write-offs was partially offset by the continued favorable impact of our technology investments, which include decisioning algorithms and customer payment platforms as well as our team's strong operational execution.\n",
      "As we discussed on prior earnings calls, we continue to expect that annual write-offs will be between 4% to 5% of lease revenues and fees.\n",
      "Adjusted EBITDA for the company was $53.6 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared with $64.3 million for the same period in 2020, a decrease of $10.7 million or 16.6%.\n",
      "As a percentage of revenues, adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.9% in the third quarter of 2021 compared to 14.6% for the same period in 2020.\n",
      "This expected decline in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin was due to lower customer payment activity, higher lease merchandise write-offs and higher personnel costs compared to the prior year levels.\n",
      "On a non-GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share were $0.83 in the third quarter of 2021 compared with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.10 for the same quarter in 2020.\n",
      "Cash generated from operating activities was $30.2 million for the third quarter of 2021, a decline of $92.6 million compared to the third quarter of 2020.\n",
      "This decline was primarily due to incremental purchases of lease merchandise to meet increased customer demand and to mitigate the impact of anticipated supply chain challenges ahead of the upcoming holiday season.\n",
      "In addition, the cost of our lease merchandise was adversely impacted by inflationary pressure.\n",
      "During the third quarter, the company purchased approximately 1,333,000 shares of Aaron's common stock for a total purchase price of approximately $37.5 million and through a 10b5-1 plan continue to repurchase shares into the first month of the current quarter.\n",
      "For the year-to-date period ended October 22, 2021, the company has repurchased 3,034,000 shares for approximately $90.4 million.\n",
      "As of October 22, we had approximately $60 million remaining under the company's $150 million share repurchase program that was approved by our Board in March of this year and ends December 31, 2023.\n",
      "Additionally, the company's Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend in August of $0.10 per share, which was paid on October 5.\n",
      "As of September 30, 2021, the company had a cash balance of $15 million, no outstanding debt and total available liquidity of $248 million, which includes $233 million available under our unsecured revolving credit facility.\n",
      "As Douglas highlighted in his remarks, we have again raised our full year revenue and adjusted EBITDA outlook for 2021.\n",
      "For the full year, we have increased our outlook for total revenues to between $1.82 billion and $1.83 billion.\n",
      "We also increased our outlook for adjusted EBITDA to between $225 million and $230 million.\n",
      "For the full year 2021, we have maintained our outlook for an effective tax rate of 26%; we expect depreciation and amortization of approximately $70 million, and we expect the diluted weighted average share count for full year 2021 to be 34 million shares.\n",
      "We have not assumed any additional shares repurchased beyond what has been discussed earlier on the call.\n",
      "We have also increased our full year same-store revenues outlook from a range of 6% to 8% to a range of 7.5% to 8.5%.\n",
      "This increase is primarily a result of the continued year-over-year growth in our lease portfolio size.\n",
      "We have maintained our expected capital expenditure range of $90 million to $100 million.\n",
      "We have reduced our free cash flow outlook for 2021 to $30 million to $40 million, primarily to reflect the significant investment in lease merchandise inventory the company has made to mitigate the impact of global supply chain challenges and the related inflationary pressures.\n",
      "Based on our current inventory levels, we do not anticipate any material challenges in meeting our customers' product demand as we end 2021 and head into 2022.\n",
      "As I have previously described, benefits to our customer from government stimulus programs have moderated in the third quarter.\n",
      "Our revised outlook continues to assume customer lease payment activity remains higher in the fourth quarter of 2021 when compared to pre COVID-19 pandemic levels, but lower than the fourth quarter of 2020.\n",
      "At the same time, we believe the favorable impact of centralized lease decisioning, our digital servicing platforms and other operational enhancements are contributing to a sustainable improvement in customer payment and write-off activity.\n",
      "Additionally, we expect write-offs will continue to be lower in the fourth quarter of 2021 when compared to pre COVID-19 pandemic levels but higher than the fourth quarter of 2020.\n",
      "Finally, our updated outlook assumes no significant deterioration in the current retail environment, state of the US economy or global supply chain as compared to their current conditions.\n"
